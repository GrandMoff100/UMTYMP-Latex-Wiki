The ultimate guide on how to write your assignments in LaTeX.
Wait what? What's LaTex?

The History
============
Well... LaTeX was first created in 1985 by Leslie Lamport.
Its a free open-source software package created as an addition
to the TeX typesetting system. For reference, TeX essentially took text
like {\\it this text is italic} and formatted it like *this text is italic*.
Because of its extensive and powerful capabilities the TeX system became very widely adopted.
In 1985, LaTeX was created to generate general-purpose books, articles, etc in a better way.
Fast forward to today, LaTeX is the *de facto* standard for writing academic papers, research papers,
format mathematical equations, and express formal notation in a reproducable way.

TL;DR Everyone uses LaTeX because its awesome and you should to!

=============================
