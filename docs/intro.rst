Introduction to LaTeX
######################

There are a variety of guides out there to learn LaTeX.
One in particular that I like and used is `Learn Latex in 30 minutes <https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes>`_.
It explains the basics of LaTeX that apply to all contexts and not just your UMTYMP homework.
LaTeX is a valuable skill that helps you communicate better with mathematicians, scientists, and other academic communities.
If you just want to use it for your homework see the :doc:`umtymp` page.
